(Only a portion of a much larger listing is given here.)

  The format is <rating> <status> <handle>.

Rating:  Only one set of ratings are displayed -- the default is bughouse unless
  another rating is requested.    The entry ---- means this user is registered
  but does not have a rating for this type of chess.  The entry ++++ means
  that the user is unregistered and thus has no rating.
