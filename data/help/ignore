ignore

Usage: +|-|= ignore [user]

  When a player is on your ignore list, you will not hear anything from
  him/her when he/she tells, shouts, kibitzes, whispers and says.  When
  users on your ignore list send you a direct message using "tell", they will be
  not notified of their being on your ignore list.  Here are the variations of the
  command possible:

      +ignore user     Add "user" to ignore list
          -ignore user     Remove "user" from ignore list
              =ignore          Display your ignore list
